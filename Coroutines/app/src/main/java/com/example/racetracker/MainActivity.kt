/**
 * Structured concurrency ->
 *
 * The way you write code using coroutines is called structured concurrency.
 * This style of programming improves the readability and development time of your code.
 * The idea of structured concurrency is that coroutines have a hierarchyâ€”tasks might launch subtasks,
 * which might launch subtasks in turn. The unit of this hierarchy is referred to as a coroutine scope.
 * Coroutine scopes should always be associated with a lifecycle.
 *
 * The Coroutines APIs adhere to this structured concurrency by design.
 * You cannot call a suspend function from a function which is not marked suspend.
 * This limitation ensures that you call the suspend functions from coroutine builders,
 * such as launch. These builders are, in turn, tied to a CoroutineScope.
